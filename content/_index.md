    description: Arianna graduated from Virginia Tech in 2019, where she studied Computer Science, Biological Sciences, and Computational Modeling and Data Analytics. She has had a long-standing interest in mathematics and operational thinking on one hand, and biology, marine science, and naturalism of the other, and has been so pleasantly surprised to find a natural combination of the two in her work.
