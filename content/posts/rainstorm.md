I had a fantastic time teaching for Rainstorm last weekend! This was the first ever Rainstorm, an offshoot of the typical program put on by MIT's [Educational Studies Program (ESP)](https://esp.mit.edu/). Along with their partner organization, Cloud Learning U/[Learning Unlimited](https://cloud.learningu.org/), they put together a virtual event this year to replace Spark!, which was set for March and, unfortunately, cancelled due to COVID-19. 

I had about an hour to chat with high school students about *Emiliania huxleyi* and their viruses, one of my favorite topics!

The students did a great job of interacting virtually, and provided me with some helpful feedback for teaching. Looking forward to more events in the future!
