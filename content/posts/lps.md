Being a penpal for the [Letters to a Pre-Scientist (LPS)](https://www.prescientist.org/) program was one of the most valuable experiences I had during my first year in graduate school. I was inspired to participate in the program by my previous mentor at Virginia Tech. Paired with a sixth grader with some interest in ocean science, it was a joy to share in her curiosity and ambition. Though only in sixth grade, my pre-scientist penpal already has a plan in mind for her future.

Even though the school year didn't end the way we planned, my student sent me a virtual letter during the final round. I was so impressed with the continuity that the LPS team provided for the program in the wake of unforeseen circumstances. My pre-scientist was disappointed to have to stay home, but stayed optimistic even so, and always expressed excitement to hear about what I was up to. She even asked about how coronavirus had affected me and my research. Her last letter in particular really was a ray of sunshine and a source of inspiration.

I can't wait to participate again next year! Here's hoping I am blessed with a second match.
