I am a biological oceanographer and microbial ecologist in the MIT-WHOI Joint Program, where I study _coccolithophores_ using _bioinformatics and modeling_.

I graduated from Virginia Tech in 2019, where I studied Computer Science, Biological Sciences, and Computational Modeling and Data Analytics. I have had a long-standing interest in mathematics and operational thinking on one hand, and biology, marine science, and naturalism of the other, and I have been so pleasantly surprised to find a natural combination of the two in my work.
